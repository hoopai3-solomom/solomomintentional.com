          <p class="testimonial-text">Lisa's knowledge of the IVF process is incredibly thoughtful and practical. She helped me understand what to expect, ask the right questions, and feel more confident in my decisions. Having her insight brought a sense of calm and clarity during a time that can otherwise feel very uncertain. I'm so grateful for her guidance during such an emotional journey.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">When I spoke with Lisa, I had already gone through IVF and the sperm donor process, but I was starting to get scared about how I would manage it all as a single mom with a demanding career. Talking to Lisa put me at ease. She did not sugarcoat the hard parts, but she showed me how it can work. I walked away feeling so much better.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">I felt stressed from every angle-job, getting older, being single even though I was trying to find someone-and egg freezing scared me. Lisa normalized everything I was feeling and helped me approach it with confidence instead of fear. And now I have healthy eggs for when I am ready which puts me at ease.</p>
